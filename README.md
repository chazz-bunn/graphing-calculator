Feature to add: Factorials

Issue: Vertical Asymptotes get drawn when I don't want them to, need a solution to fix that.
    Categories of asymptotes:
        Rational expressions
        Roots
        Logarithmic functions
        Trig functions
    An idea to deal with rational expressions is to not when dividing by a variable and finding what makes the denominator equal zero

Issue: When graphing x^-2 it graphs (x^-1)*2, x^(-2) is correct. Perhaps I'll fix it when I overhaul UI.
